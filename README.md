### w3schools

W3Schools is a web developers site, with tutorials and references on web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, jQuery, Java, W3.CSS, and Bootstrap, covering most aspects of web programming. 

W3schools is the place for me to find the answer and gain inspiration from. First, for example, experience of making two columns in a div tag in HTML was a nightmare, i tried to use float and width property in CSS to achieve the goal, but i had no luck. After googled the question online, goole leading me to the tutor on W3schools.com. The tutor not only explaining the way those properties works, also giving us some examples. Therfore, making people more easy to understand how to use the elementsor properties properly. Secondly, the "How to" section in W3schools.com has lots of tutors and examples of effects inspiring me. For instance, "Shake an Image" effect showing on CSS How To Section is using in my porfolio gallary page.

### Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share​ ​their programming ​knowledge, and build their careers.

Stack Overflow has rich resources, planty of posted questions and answers on the site. Most of the time, my questions would be someone else's questions as well. Thence, for me, trying to find answer on Stack Overflow definitely is the step defore asking TA or other classmates, and it goes well!
